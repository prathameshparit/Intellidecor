## Problem Statement
Many people struggle to visualize multiple design options without physically placing furniture and decor in the space. This process uses time and resources, as clients have to physically set up and take down multiple design configurations. Our solution aims to provide clients with multiple design alternatives that they can explore virtually, saving time and resources, while allowing them to make informed design decisions.
